## Overview

Restoran Clone is a fully functional restaurant website built using React and Bootstrap CSS, inspired by a ditributed demo from Theme Wagon. Instead of directly using the original HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap code, I redesigned the site in React to utilize reusable components, enhancing code efficiency and maintainability. This approach allowed me to better understand how to structure and translate existing code into a React framework.

The website features an intuitive layout, an interactive menu display, a reservation system, and is optimized for mobile devices. It includes engaging animations and components to elevate the user experience, making it an excellent tool for showcasing web design and development skills.


### Project Goals

- Develop a responsive restaurant website with reusable React components.
